/**
 * @brief Madgwick AHRS (Attitude and Heading Reference System) filter
 * implementation
 *
 * This class implements the Madgwick AHRS algorithm for sensor fusion of
 * gyroscope and accelerometer data to estimate orientation in 3D space.
 * The filter uses a quaternion representation and gradient descent algorithm
 * to compute the orientation estimate.
 *
 * Coordinate System: x forward, y left, z up (NED - North East Down convention)
 *
 * The algorithm was originally developed by Sebastian O.H. Madgwick and is
 * particularly suited for real-time applications due to its computational
 * efficiency.
 *
 * @note This implementation does not include magnetometer fusion. For full AHRS
 *       functionality with yaw drift correction, magnetometer data should be
 * added.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * @code
 * using namespace units::literals;
 *
 * // Create filter with 100Hz sample rate and default beta (0.3)
 * Madgwick filter(100_Hz, 0.1f);
 *
 * // Tare the filter to set initial orientation
 * filter.tare();
 *
 * // Update filter with sensor data
 * filter.calculate(gx, gy, gz, ax, ay, az);
 *
 * // Get orientation angles
 * auto roll = filter.roll();
 * auto pitch = filter.pitch();
 * auto yaw = filter.yaw();
 * @endcode

 * @brief High-level IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) wrapper with sensor fusion
 *
 * This class provides a high-level interface to VEX V5 IMU sensors with
 * integrated Madgwick AHRS sensor fusion filtering. It wraps the PROS IMU API
 * and automatically applies sensor fusion to provide stable and accurate
 * orientation estimates.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Automatic sensor fusion using Madgwick AHRS algorithm
 * - Thread-safe operation with mutex protection
 * - Built-in calibration and drift correction
 * - Continuous background sensor reading at 100Hz
 * - Stable heading output with automatic zeroing
 *
 * Coordinate System: Same as PROS IMU (x forward, y left, z up)
 *
 * The class automatically:
 * 1. Starts a background task for continuous sensor reading
 * 2. Applies Madgwick filtering to raw sensor data
 * 3. Calibrates the sensor on startup
 * 4. Provides thread-safe access to filtered orientation data
 *
 * @note This class is designed for robotics applications where stable
 * orientation estimation is critical, such as autonomous navigation systems.

 * Example usage:
 * @code
 * using namespace vilot::device;
